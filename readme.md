#   wyskr

a lightweight game engine with the purpose of learning general engine development as well as rendering libraries opengl and ncurses.

## todo

storing todos here temporarily until i can be bothered to organise a trello
these are listed in approximate order of priority

### core

*   implement separate curses/opengl contexts

### curses

### opengl

*   create shader registry to stop shaders getting compiled multiple times
*   turn camera into component
*   make main loop framerate independent, currently relying on sdl's frame cap
*   use cmake to handle cross-platform development
*   load models

### misc i guess lol

*   handle fullscreen window
*   check for dependencies on startup
